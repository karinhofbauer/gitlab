<h2>Git - lab</h2>
<p>The intention with this lab is to give an understanding of what Git is and how it works. It will show the benefits of using Git as your versioning tool and hopefully make you comfortable enough to start using it in your new and current projects. The lab consists of 4 different parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./introduction/index.html">Basics</a><p>Shows the basic commands of git. Adding values to the config, adding files, committing files, moving files and deleting files.</p></li>
 
<li><a href="./branching/index.html">Branching</a><p>Create branches and learn how to switch in between them.</p></li>

<li><a href="./rebase/index.html">Rebasing and merging</a><p>Merge branches or rebase and push. Delete branches when done with them.</p></li>

</ol>
